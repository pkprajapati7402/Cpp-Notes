Row Major: 
    we represent all the elements of a 2d matrix, into a single array as  a row.
    to find the index of an element in that particular row.
    Index(of element in the row) = Row_index * numberOfColumns + Column_index

    on dividing above expression with column, we get

    shortcut (:
    Index = (Position of element / number of columns)  *
